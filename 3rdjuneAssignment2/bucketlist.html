    <h1>My Travel Bucket List</h1>
    <p>For me, travel isn't about crowded tourist spots — it's about connection, culture, and quiet beauty. Here's my
        list of dream destinations that nourish the soul.

    </p>
    <h2>1. Bali, Indonesia - The Island of Gods</h2>

    <p>From healing temples to jungle waterfalls, Bali is not just a place — it's a journey into balance, nature, and
        spiritual calm.</p>

    <h2>2. Chefchaouen, Morocco - The Blue Pearl</h2>

    <p>A quiet town painted entirely in blue, Chefchaouen offers calm, color, and charm tucked away in Morocco's Rif
        Mountains.</p>

    <h2>3. Northern Lights - Chasing Aurora in Norway</h2>

    <p>I dream of lying on snow under a glowing sky, watching ribbons of green and purple dance silently above. The
        Northern Lights are nature’s own fairytale show.</p>
